# Portfolio

This is going to be a kind of meta project as a portfolio for a bunch of things. They break down mostly into four areas
- Project Management
- Development
- QA
- Systems Engineering
I have worked in these and in hybrid roles for them. They have various names like Devops, Systems Analyst, QA Engineer, Test Engineer etc. I try to get this across in my resume, but I thought that a portfolio project would be better. I also plan to go over quite a bit of this on my blog as I go through it. The blog posts will be held here in markdown files as well. Mostly so I don't lose them, but also so people don't have to go back and forth if they don't want to.
